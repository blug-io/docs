# Welcome to Blug Documentation

This is the **Blug API** documentation. Each folder usually represents a step in a path to the endpoint. For example, you can expect the **Auth** folder to cover endpoints starting with `/auth/`.

The **Blug API** is organized around **REST**. Our API uses:

- **Resource-oriented URLs**  
- **JSON-encoded** request bodies  
- Returns **JSON-encoded** responses  
- Utilizes standard **HTTP** response codes, authentication, and methods  

With the **Blug API**, developers and technical writers can efficiently manage content creation, updates, and distribution across multiple platforms â€” all from a single location.
